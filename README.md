# zoeyscripts

This is a repository for the scripts I write and would like to keep around. A lot of these won’t be pretty, but they get what I need done. I don’t know if anyone will find these useful but eh. It’s good at looking back at what I’ve learned.

There’s Ansible playbooks in Ansible/, and that’s it so far. More will be added when I can come up with new things to add here.
