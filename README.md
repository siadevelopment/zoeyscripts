# zoeyscripts

This is a repository for the scripts I write and would like to keep around. A lot of these won’t be pretty, but they get what I need done. I don’t know if anyone will find these useful but eh. It’s good at looking back at what I’ve learned.

Hmmm. I just noticed that git uploads unfinished scripts such as NPM, azure-cassandra, and the DNS files. These will be updated whenever I get working configs working. Stay tuned.
